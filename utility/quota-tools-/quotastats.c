/*
 * QUOTA    An implementation of the diskquota system for the LINUX operating
 *          system. QUOTA is implemented using the BSD systemcall interface
 *          as the means of communication with the user level. Should work for
 *          all filesystems because of integration into the VFS layer of the
 *          operating system. This is based on the Melbourne quota system wich
 *          uses both user and group quota files.
 * 
 *          Program to query for the internal statistics.
